local authentication and MVC


Create your very own TODO List


requires a form for signup and login
forms handle posts well because there's no client side javascript. It's builtin
forms handle post request natively
we just specify the method and send it up

checking to see if certain conditions are met with password is validation
- password must be 8 characters long

username
email
password
confirm password

validation on all fields

ROUTE PROTECTION

- todo page can't be seen if user isn't logged in
- reroutes for when users need to login, signup, or logout
